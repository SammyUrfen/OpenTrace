# OpenTrace — Product Roadmap & Architecture Specification

> **One-line truth:** OpenTrace is an intelligent magnifying glass for developers — a local-first observability tool that makes complex software behavior *readable*, not just measurable.

**Platform:** Linux (primary). macOS deferred. Windows not planned.  
**Distribution:** Electron desktop app. Self-contained. No browser window.

---

## Current Milestone

> **Status (as of 2026-06-22):** Phases **0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 complete**. The full
> loop works — type a command → transparent strace+psutil trace → analytics tabs
> (Overview, Timeline, Memory, CPU, I/O, Network, Processes, Syscalls, Logs)
> → AI summary → run-to-run **diff view**. Plus sessions (create/switch),
> selectable collectors, an espresso/warm-paper theme, a first-run wizard,
> **18 detection rules**, **real-time anomaly alerts**, **resizable panels**, and
> paired v1/v2 demo fixtures in `test-files/`.
>
> **Phase 6 (profiling) is in:** a **collector-mode choice** — strace OR ltrace
> (both ptrace, mutually exclusive) plus an independent **perf** sampler. ltrace
> mode adds a **Profiling tab** (malloc/free ledger: bytes alloc/freed, peak live,
> leaked blocks, + a library-call hotspot table) and a `heap_leak` /
> `alloc_free_imbalance` anomaly. perf adds a **Flamegraph tab** (an inline
> click-to-zoom flame chart + self/total symbol hotspots). **134 tests** (94
> backend pytest + 40 frontend vitest), verified end-to-end through the real
> `otrace` launcher (real ltrace + perf captures rendered in both tabs), and
> hardened against an adversarial multi-agent review of the diff.
>
> **Next:** Phase 7 (packaging `.deb`/`.AppImage` + libsecret keyring + session
> export), Phase 8 (advanced).

## 1. Product Philosophy

OpenTrace is **not** an autopilot debugging tool. It is a productivity layer that collapses the feedback loop between "something is wrong" and "I understand what is wrong."

The moment it eliminates:

> A developer spends 3 hours cross-referencing `strace` output, `htop`, `lsof`, log files, and gut instinct — trying to understand why their program is slow, hung, or burning memory.

OpenTrace compresses that to minutes. The guiding principle behind every design decision is: **take labour away from the developer**. Data is never dumped raw. Everything is correlated, ranked, and presented with enough visual context that the developer's eye goes immediately to what matters — not to a wall of numbers.

What OpenTrace explicitly does **not** do:
- Automatically patch or fix code
- Make autonomous decisions about the system
- Replace the developer's judgment

What it does relentlessly:
- Collect low-level system signals without the developer touching a single tracing tool
- Detect patterns that are invisible when looking at any one signal in isolation
- Present findings visually: graphs over tables, highlights over dumps, timelines over logs
- Let the developer immediately act on what they see

---

## 2. UX Design & Layout

### Design Language

OpenTrace's visual design is inspired by Claude.ai — clean, modern, and readable in both dark and light mode. The aesthetic sits between a developer tool and a polished product: not the raw utilitarian look of a terminal, not the over-designed look of a SaaS dashboard. Typography is large and readable, colours are used sparingly and meaningfully (red = problem, amber = warning, green = healthy, blue = neutral data).

The default theme is dark mode. Light mode is a first-class citizen, not an afterthought. Both are defined from shared design tokens — no "light mode as an afterthought" inversion.

### Right Sidebar

The sidebar is on the **right by default**, position configurable by the user. Structured like VSCode's explorer — collapsible sections, not a flat list. Hide/show with `Ctrl+B`.

**Sessions section (expanded by default):**
- Lists all saved sessions grouped by process/command name (basename)
- Each group is a collapsible sub-list of individual runs, sorted newest first
- Each entry shows: timestamp, duration, and a severity dot (● red = CRITICAL/HIGH, ○ amber = MEDIUM, · green = clean)
- Right-click context menu: Open, Rename label, Compare with…, Delete
- Search/filter bar at top of the section
- Clicking an entry opens that session in the main content area (new main tab)

**Terminal section (collapsed by default):**
- Expanding reveals a toggle to show/hide the bottom panel
- Shows current state: Tracing / Idle / OpenTrace OFF
- Collapsing hides the bottom panel

---

### Main Tab Bar

Each open session gets a tab. Tabs show: session filename, severity dot, user label in parentheses if set, and a close button.

**Special tab types:**
- **Welcome tab** — shown on first launch and when no sessions are open
- **Diff tab** — `python_20240315 ↔ python_20240314` — created via "Compare with…" in the sidebar context menu

---

### Secondary Tab Bar

Below the main tab bar, scoped to the active tab.

**Regular session:**
```
[ Overview ] [ Timeline ] [ Syscalls ] [ Memory ] [ I/O ] [ Network ] [ CPU ] [ Processes ] [ Logs ]
```

**Diff tab:**
```
[ Overview Diff ] [ Memory Diff ] [ Syscall Diff ] [ I/O Diff ] [ Anomaly Diff ]
```

---

### Bottom Panel — Terminal + Live Monitor

Split horizontally into two resizable panes.

**Left pane — Terminal:**
- Full terminal emulation (xterm.js + node-pty)
- Rooted at the directory from which `opentrace` was invoked
- User types **normal commands** — no `opentrace run` prefix required
- OpenTrace intercepts the command and wraps it with selected collectors transparently
- The program's stdout/stderr appears exactly as it would in a plain terminal

**Right pane — Live Monitor:**
- Active during a trace and shows final values after session ends
- Live sparkline graphs for each enabled metric
- Collector toggles: ☑ CPU / ☑ Memory / ☑ Syscalls / ☑ File I/O / ☐ Network / ☐ Perf / ☐ ltrace
- Real-time anomaly alerts as they fire: `⚠ FD count exceeds 200 — possible leak`
- **[OpenTrace ON / OFF] master toggle** — OFF = plain terminal, zero overhead, no restart needed
- When tracing: elapsed time, current RSS, pulsing status dot

---

### Session Naming Convention

```
<command_basename>_<YYYYMMDD>_<HHMMSS>
```

Examples: `python_20240315_143022` · `node_20240315_150100` · `a.out_20240315_161500`

User can add a human-readable label on top (never replaces the filename).

---

### Diff View

Right-click a session → "Compare with…" → select second session → opens `A ↔ B` tab.

Secondary tabs for diff: Overview Diff · Memory Diff · Syscall Diff · I/O Diff · Anomaly Diff

Each diff tab is either a side-by-side comparison or overlaid graphs with a ∆ column/shading.

---

## 3. App Flow

### Launching

```bash
opentrace          # Opens the Electron window from any directory.
                   # CWD becomes the terminal root.
```

`opentrace` is a globally installed binary. Running it from anywhere opens the window.

---

### Virtual Environment Compatibility

**When packaged (AppImage/deb):** The Python backend is fully bundled via PyInstaller. The user needs no Python environment. The embedded terminal spawns a login shell (`bash -l`) which sources `~/.bashrc` — including conda init. `conda activate myenv` works normally inside the terminal. Whatever the user activates there is what their programs see. The OpenTrace backend is isolated and invisible to that.

**When running in development:** The developer has two separate concerns that don't interfere:
1. The OpenTrace backend (FastAPI) runs in its own conda env (e.g. `opentrace-dev`)
2. Programs being traced run in whatever env the user activates in the embedded terminal

These are independent. The embedded terminal spawns a new shell that sources rc files, so you can `conda activate another-project-env` inside it and trace programs from that env. The `opentrace` command itself should be invoked from the `opentrace-dev` env, but that's the only constraint.

---

### First Launch

          [Save & Open OpenTrace]
                    │
          Main window — Welcome tab
```

---

### Running a Trace

1. Developer opens OpenTrace (`opentrace` from any terminal)
2. Types normal run command in the terminal pane — no prefix:
   ```
   python app.py
   ./build/my_binary --config prod.yaml
   node server.js
   java -jar app.jar
   cargo run
   ```
3. OpenTrace wraps the command transparently with selected collectors
4. Live Monitor activates with real-time sparklines
5. Program's output appears in terminal exactly as normal

---

### Short-lived vs Long-running

**Short-lived (exits on its own):** Tracing ends on process exit. Analytics computed, session saved, tab opens automatically.

**Long-running (web server, daemon):** Real-time anomaly alerts fire in Live Monitor. User stops via `Ctrl+C` or `■ Stop` button. Analytics computed, session saved, tab opens.

In both cases the session is saved before AI summary is ready. AI streams in asynchronously.

---

### Session Lifecycle

| Event | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Process exits / trace stopped | Session saved, tab opened, AI summary streams in |
| Same command runs again | New session created. Previous session untouched. |
| User closes a session tab | Session stays in sidebar. Just not open. |
| User deletes a session | Permanently removed. Confirmation dialog. No undo. |
| Storage warning (> 5 GB total) | Banner in sidebar suggesting pruning |
| App restarts | All sessions intact. Previously open tabs restored. |

```

The FastAPI server starts as a child process of Electron's main process. React communicates with it over localhost HTTP (REST) and WebSocket. The developer sees only a native app.

---

### Trace Engine

```python
# User typed: python app.py
# OpenTrace executes transparently:
subprocess.Popen(
    ["strace", "-f", "-T", "-ttt", "-e", "trace=all",
     f"--output={session_dir}/strace.log", "--",
     "python", "app.py"],
    stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE
)
# Simultaneously: psutil poll loop, procfs reader, lsof poller
```

**Collectors:**

| Collector | Data | Sampling |
|---|---|---|
| `strace -f -T` | Every syscall: name, args, return, latency, PID | Every call |
| `psutil` | CPU%, RSS, VMS, threads, FDs, IO counters | Every 250ms |
| `/proc/[pid]/maps` | Memory mappings, heap/stack regions | Every 500ms |
| `/proc/[pid]/fdinfo` + `lsof` | Open FDs with resolved paths | Every 500ms |
| `/proc/[pid]/status` | Context switches, process state | Every 250ms |
| `/proc/net/tcp` | Active TCP connections | Every 500ms |
| `ltrace -f` | Library calls: malloc, free, fopen, etc. | Every call (opt-in) |
| `perf stat -p` | Hardware counters | Aggregated (opt-in) |
| `perf record -g -p` | CPU call graph for flamegraph | Sampled (opt-in) |
| stdout/stderr | Program's own output | Streamed |

---

## 5. Monitoring & Detection Specification

### Anomaly Severity

| Level | Colour | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| CRITICAL | Red | Almost certainly causing visible problems. |
| HIGH | Orange | Significant inefficiency or likely bug. |
| MEDIUM | Amber | Unusual pattern worth reviewing. |
| LOW | Blue | Informational. |

Every anomaly includes: rule name, severity, occurrence count, time window, total time affected, and evidence event IDs clickable to jump to in the Timeline.

---

### Detection Rules

#### CPU & Execution

| Rule | Detection | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| Spin loop / busy-wait | High CPU + `poll`/`epoll_wait` with timeout=0 in tight loop | HIGH |
| Pure CPU-bound | CPU > 90% sustained > 2s with near-zero syscall rate | MEDIUM |
| Thread starvation | N threads exist, only 1 ever runs (context switch ratio) | HIGH |
| Excessive context switches | > 10,000 voluntary/s | MEDIUM |
| Hot function | Via perf: single function > 30% of CPU samples | HIGH |
| Infinite loop (no progress) | Running > 30s with zero syscalls | CRITICAL |

#### Memory

| Rule | Detection | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| Monotonic memory growth | RSS grows every 5s without ever decreasing | HIGH |
| Memory spike | RSS increases > 100MB within 500ms | MEDIUM |
| Allocation storm | malloc rate via ltrace > 10,000/s sustained | MEDIUM |
| Malloc/free imbalance | malloc count exceeds free count by > 10% at session end | HIGH |

#### File I/O

| Rule | Detection | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| Repeated open/close on same file | Same path opened > 10 times — missing persistent handle | HIGH |
| FD never closed | openat with no matching close by session end | HIGH |
| FD count growing monotonically | Open FD count grows throughout session | CRITICAL |
| Slow file I/O | Single read/write latency > 100ms | HIGH |
| Small read storm | read() with count < 512 bytes at > 500 calls/s | MEDIUM |
| Write amplification | Many tiny writes to same file | MEDIUM |
| Failed file opens | ENOENT or EACCES on openat | MEDIUM |
| Logging inside hot loop | > 1000 writes/s to a log file | MEDIUM |

#### Network

| Rule | Detection | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| DNS not cached | getaddrinfo for same hostname > 5 times | HIGH |
| Slow DNS | getaddrinfo latency > 200ms | HIGH |
| Connection refused / reset | ECONNREFUSED or ECONNRESET | HIGH |
| No connection reuse | New TCP connection per operation to same host | HIGH |
| Blocking network on main thread | Network syscall on main thread with latency > 100ms | HIGH |

#### Processes & Syscalls

| Rule | Detection | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| Excessive subprocess spawning | > 50 execve calls | MEDIUM |
| Single slow syscall | Any syscall latency > 1s | HIGH |
| Mutex contention | futex WAIT with latency > 10ms, repeated | HIGH |
| I/O retry loop | Same syscall on same FD > 100 times within 1s | HIGH |

---

### Function-Level Resource Attribution (opt-in)

When `perf record` or `ltrace` is enabled, a **Function Hotspot Table** appears in the CPU tab: scrollable list sorted by CPU time consumed, with function name, library, CPU%, call count, memory allocated, and average duration. Clicking any row filters the Timeline to that function's events.

---

### Visual Highlighting Conventions

| Signal | Visual Treatment |
|---|---|
| CRITICAL / HIGH anomaly | Red background tint on row, card, or graph region |
| MEDIUM anomaly | Amber left border or underline |
| LOW | Blue dot or subtle label |
| Metric above threshold | Value text coloured red/amber, bolded |
| Anomaly time window on graph | Vertical shaded region |
| Anomaly callout | Small annotation pinned to graph at first occurrence |
| Log line with anomaly | Coloured left border |
| Failed syscall | Red text, strikethrough on return value |

---

## 6. Analytics & Visualization Specification

Each secondary tab is a visualization with one primary insight, supporting detail below or on click.

### Prompt Design

The LLM receives a carefully constructed structured summary — not raw event data. This keeps cost low and responses focused. The prompt instructs the LLM to:

1. **What's Wrong** — interpret patterns, not just list them
2. **Why It Matters** — quantify impact ("89% of your runtime")
3. **What to Investigate** — specific files, functions, call patterns
4. **What Looks Fine** — prevent wasted investigation
5. **Confidence** — explicit uncertainty acknowledgment

There is no word limit. Clarity is the goal, not brevity.

---

### Fallback (No LLM)

Every anomaly rule has a template that generates plain-English descriptions from event data. The tool is fully useful without any AI dependency. The LLM adds interpretation; the rule engine provides the findings.

---

### Diff Summary

Separate LLM call for diff view. Prompt includes the delta between anomaly lists and key metric changes. Answers: "What changed between these two runs, and is it better or worse?"

## 10. Phase Roadmap

### Phase 0 — Foundation (Week 1)
- [x] Monorepo: `/backend`, `/frontend`, `/electron`, `/docs`
- [x] `opentrace` CLI binary: opens Electron window, passes CWD *(dev launcher `app.cli`; PyInstaller packaging deferred)*
- [x] Electron boots, starts FastAPI backend as child process
- [x] xterm.js + node-pty terminal in bottom panel
- [x] Command interception: wraps execution with strace + psutil when ON
- [x] SQLite initialized on first run
- [x] `config.json` created with defaults
- [x] OpenTrace ON/OFF toggle functional

### Phase 1 — Data Pipeline (Weeks 2–3)
- [x] strace parser → TraceEvent schema
- [x] psutil poller → metrics table
- [x] FD path resolver via procfs
- [x] Event normalization and storage (SQLite + `events.ndjson.zst` / `metrics.ndjson.zst` / `meta.json`)
- [x] Run lifecycle (start, poll, finalize, save) over `/runs/*` + `otrace` wrapper
- [x] *(bonus)* foundational anomaly rule engine + SSE live channel

> **Data model note:** the flat Phase-0 `sessions` table was replaced by the
> three-level **sessions (projects) → terminals → runs** model; events/metrics/
> anomalies/artifacts now key off `run_id`. Interception is a zsh line-rewrite
> (`accept-line` widget → `otrace -- <cmd>`), not the original preexec re-run.
> Live updates use **SSE** rather than WebSocket (no extra native dep).

### Phase 2 — Setup UX + Sidebar (Weeks 4–5)
- [x] First-run wizard (LLM config + collector defaults)
- [ ] API key in libsecret *(file-based secret store exists; keyring swap deferred)*
- [x] Right sidebar: sessions (projects) → runs with severity dots; **create + switch sessions**
- [x] Right-click context menu (Open / Delete a run; middle-click closes a tab)
- [x] Main tab bar + secondary tab bar (real: open runs as tabs, per-run views)
- [x] Overview tab: execution snapshot + top anomaly cards
- [x] Live Monitor: real-time sparklines (SSE) + **collector toggles** (strace/psutil
      functional; ltrace/perf opt-in Phase 6)
- [~] Settings (LLM modal + Test Connection; first-run wizard covers onboarding)
- [x] *(§2)* first-class light/dark theme — **espresso (dark) / warm-paper (light)**,
      shared tokens, toggle, terminal re-themes

### Phase 3 — Analytics Views (Weeks 6–9)
- [x] Secondary tabs with real data — all 9 built: **Overview, Timeline, Memory, CPU,
      I/O, Network, Processes, Syscalls, Logs** (custom SVG timeline + process table)
- [x] Detection rule engine — **18 rules** covering most of §5 (file I/O, memory,
      CPU/spin/infinite-loop, network errors/reuse, mutex contention, I/O retry,
      read/write storms, subprocess spawning). ltrace/perf-derived rules → Phase 6.
- [x] Severity highlighting (dots, colored anomaly cards, threshold lines, red errors,
      ⊘ fd-leak markers, anomaly-window shading in Timeline + Logs)
- [x] Real-time anomaly alerts in Live Monitor (live FD>200 / memory-spike /
      sustained-CPU alerts streamed over SSE during the run)

### Phase 4 — LLM Integration (Weeks 10–11)
- [x] Streaming LLM call → sectioned summary in Overview (OpenAI-compatible;
      default Google Gemini/Gemma; thought-chunk filtering for reasoning models)
- [x] Rule-based fallback descriptions (anomaly cards render without an LLM)
- [x] Re-analyze button, error handling, Settings modal (base/model/key + test),
      API key in the secret store (never in config)

### Phase 5 — Diff View (Week 12) — DONE
- [x] "Compare with…" context menu → opens an A ↔ B diff tab
- [x] Diff secondary tabs: Overview Δ · Memory Δ · CPU Δ · Syscalls Δ · Anomalies Δ
      (∆ column with better/worse colouring; overlaid metric charts; 3-column anomaly diff)
- [x] AI diff summary (streaming "what changed, better or worse?")

### Phase 6 — Function Profiling (Weeks 13–14) — DONE
- [x] ltrace integration (malloc/free tracking) — `ltrace -S -f -ttt -T` parser
      (`trace/ltrace_parser.py`) as a **collector-mode** choice (ptrace-exclusive
      with strace); malloc/free ledger + leak/imbalance anomalies (`profile.py`)
- [x] perf record integration + flamegraph — `perf record -g` → `perf script`
      folded into an inline click-to-zoom flame chart (`perf.py` + `FlamegraphTab`)
- [x] Function hotspot table — library-call hotspots (ltrace) in the **Profiling**
      tab; CPU self/total symbol hotspots (perf) in the **Flamegraph** tab
- [x] *(bonus)* UI fixes: chart unit-label overlap, Timeline lane clipping +
      per-lane scales, AI summary survives tab switches

### Phase 7 — Polish & Release (Weeks 15–16)
- [ ] Session export (JSON, HTML report)
- [ ] `.deb` + `.AppImage` build pipeline
- [ ] Auto-update, documentation

### Phase 8 — Advanced (Month 4+)
- [ ] eBPF / bpftrace mode
- [ ] **CI mode:** `opentrace ci ./tests.sh --baseline <session>` — runs OpenTrace non-interactively as part of a CI pipeline (GitHub Actions, etc.) and exits non-zero if performance regressed vs a saved baseline. Useful for catching memory leaks or slowdowns before they merge. Not needed until the tool is stable.
- [ ] Plugin API for custom anomaly detectors
- [ ] VS Code extension

### Phase 9 — Production Profiling: Attach-to-PID + Universal Flamegraphs

> Full design + per-runtime detail + privilege/symbolization caveats live in
> **[`Profiling_Roadmap.md`](Profiling_Roadmap.md)**. This is the tracker.

**Why:** OpenTrace today only *launches* a command (`otrace -- cmd`); a running
production service (Spring Boot / Django / Rails / Node / Go / .NET / …) is already
up. The unlock is **attach-to-a-running-PID** + **runtime auto-detection** + a
**universal folded-stack ingest** that reuses the existing `perf.py` folding +
`flamegraph.json` + `FlamegraphTab` for every language's sampler.

- [x] **Phase A — Attach spine + native/Go perf attach** *(done 2026-07-04, verified end-to-end)*
  - [x] `backend/app/attach.py`: `detect_runtime(pid)` (scan `/proc/<pid>/maps` + exe fallback) + `list_targets()` + `target_info()`
  - [x] `POST /runs/attach {pid|port, window_s}` + `GET /runs/attach/targets` (`runs.py`)
  - [x] orchestrator attach flow: `start_attach_run` → `perf record -p PID -g -F 99 -- sleep N` → `build_flamegraph()` (bounded window + subprocess-timeout watchdog, fail-open to psutil-only)
  - [x] reuse `_begin_polling(pid, descendants_only=False)` for the psutil timeline; `FlamegraphTab` unchanged
  - [x] frontend `AttachModal` picker (Run menu + palette) with per-runtime badges + symbolization hints
  - Verified: attach to a live CPU-burner → flamegraph (501 samples, real symbols) + psutil timeline; picker detects Node/JVM/native. Tests in `test_attach.py`.
- [x] **Phase A.1 — Live monitor mode + Incident Feed** *(done 2026-07-04, verified)* —
  a *monitor* mode keeps the attach run live: continuous psutil metrics + back-to-back
  bounded profiling snapshots (refresh the flamegraph + hot path) + sliding-window rule
  scans, until **Stop** or target-exit. Each anomaly becomes an **incident** with
  **when · what · where (the dominant hot call path = which classes/functions) · leading
  metric context**, streamed to an Incident Feed. Optional **continuous AI** (Settings ▸
  AI toggle) adds a short per-incident explanation. Metrics ring-buffered (retention cap).
  - [x] `start_attach_run(..., monitor=True)` → `_run_attach_monitor` loop; `POST /runs/{id}/stop`; incidents via `_make_incident` + sliding-window `_eval_sliding_rules`; hot-path **backfill** for incidents that fire before the first snapshot
  - [x] `GET /runs/{id}/incidents`; incidents in `incidents.ndjson` (storage append/read/update); continuous AI = `summarize.incident_summary` gated by `config.llm.continuous_summaries`
  - [x] AttachModal "keep monitoring" toggle; RunView **Incidents** tab + "● Monitoring — Stop" bar; `IncidentFeed`; useOpenTrace incident SSE + `stopMonitor`
  - Verified: monitor a busy process → live incident "CPU pegged" with backfilled where `<module> → render_report`, Stop finalizes. Honest limit: on-CPU sampling can't attribute OFF-CPU causes (I/O/lock/DB waits) — flagged in the feed; eBPF off-CPU is Phase D.
- [x] **Phase B — Universal folded ingest + Python/Ruby/JVM samplers** *(done 2026-07-04, verified with py-spy)*
  - [x] refactor `fold_perf_script` → shared `_fold_stacks`; add `fold_collapsed` + `fold_speedscope` (perf.py)
  - [x] sampler registry (`attach.py` `_SAMPLERS` / `profiler_plan` / `sampler_argv`): py-spy (Python), rbspy (Ruby), asprof (JVM) — used if installed, else perf; picker shows a per-runtime sampler badge + install hint
  - [x] orchestrator: attach picks the sampler; `_run_attach_profile` runs it; `_finalize` folds by format (`_fold_profile`)
  - Verified: attach a Python process with py-spy installed → flamegraph shows real Python frames (`burn` 100%), not CPython C frames. Tests: `test_perf.py` (fold_collapsed/speedscope) + `test_attach.py` (registry).
  - [ ] *(deferred)* `tools.py` detection panel for the samplers; async-profiler cpu/wall/alloc/lock event selector + unit badges
- [~] **Phase C — Node / .NET / PHP samplers** *(2026-07-06 — Node verified; .NET/PHP best-effort)*
  - [x] **Node/Deno/Bun** via the V8 inspector (`app/node_cdp.py`: SIGUSR1 → CDP-over-WebSocket, hand-rolled, no dep) + `perf.fold_cpuprofile` — **verified e2e** (live node → real JS `tick` 98.7%, 6M samples). No install needed.
  - [x] **.NET** (`dotnet-trace`→speedscope→`fold_speedscope`) + **PHP** (`phpspy`→`fold_phpspy`) registry entries + argv + parsers (unit-tested) — **UNVERIFIED** (tools not installed; need a real .NET/PHP target to confirm attach + the dotnet sibling-filename)
  - [ ] Go `pprof.py` — DEFERRED (Go CPU already covered by the native `perf` path; pprof adds only heap/lock/goroutine + needs the app to expose `net/http/pprof`)
  - [ ] BEAM/Erlang — DEFERRED (perf needs the `+JPperf` boot flag; no-restart path is a remote-shell/`eflambe`, high effort + can destabilize a prod node)
- [x] **Phase D — eBPF off-CPU + latency** *(2026-07-06 — fail-open + UI verified; real capture needs root)*
  - [x] `app/ebpf.py`: `capabilities()` probe (BTF · unpriv_bpf · caps · sudo · bcc-tools) + `GET /runs/attach/ebpf-capabilities`; AttachModal eBPF checkbox capability-gated
  - [x] Off-CPU flamegraph — `offcputime -f -p PID N` → `fold_collapsed(count_is_usec=True)` → `offcpu-flamegraph.json`; On-CPU/Off-CPU toggle in FlamegraphTab (off-CPU total via fmtDuration)
  - [x] Latency histograms — `runqlat -m -p PID` + `biolatency -m` → `parse_log2_hist` → `latency.json` + **Latency tab** (run-queue + block-I/O bar charts) + 2 rules (`high_runqueue_latency`, `slow_block_io`)
  - [x] Fail-open + capability-gated everywhere (unprivileged → clear "needs root/CAP_BPF" reasons; on-CPU + timeline unaffected). Runs concurrent with the on-CPU window in single + monitor.
  - NOTE: `biolatency` is system-wide (no per-PID filter — block I/O is host-wide); real eBPF data unverified here (host `unprivileged_bpf_disabled=2`, backend runs unprivileged)
- [~] **Phase E — containers + per-PID I/O + USDT GC + bpftrace engine** *(2026-07-06)*
  - [x] **Container awareness** — `app/container.py` (`parse_cgroup`/`container_info`/`nspid_map`/`resolve_host_pid`): label docker/podman/containerd/cri-o/k8s targets (cgroup v1+v2), resolve container-local→host PID via `/proc` NSpid. Wired into attach targets + `POST /runs/attach/resolve` + a 🐳 badge. **Verified** (pure /proc, no root; 6 tests).
  - [x] **Per-PID block I/O** — `biosnoop` filtered by PID → real percentiles (`parse_biosnoop`) → `latency.json.block_io_pid` + a Latency card. *(bcc; works on ≤6.x — fails the kernel-7.0 fs.h compile wall → fail-open.)*
  - [x] **USDT GC** — `usdt_probes(pid)` detection (readelf `.note.stapsdt`, no root — **verified** on system python3.14: gc__start/gc__done) + `pythongc` capture (`parse_ugc`) → `gc-timeline.json` + a Latency card. *(bcc pythongc fails the 7.0 wall → fail-open; needs a --enable-dtrace python.)*
  - [x] **bpftrace engine** — on kernels where bcc's headers won't compile (7.0), the run-queue + block-I/O histograms use bpftrace/CO-RE (`BT_RUNQLAT`/`BT_BIOLAT`, `parse_bpftrace_hist`, unit-normalized rules). **Implemented, UNVERIFIED** (needs `/usr/bin/bpftrace` in sudoers). offcputime (off-CPU flame) stays bcc + is **verified real**.
  - [ ] bpftrace USDT-GC + per-PID biosnoop equivalents (so GC/per-PID I/O work on very new kernels too); DB-query USDT → timeline; container→host cross-namespace attach when backend is privileged.

## 11. Resolved Decisions

| Decision | Resolution |
|---|---|
| Sessions on re-run | Always new. Previous untouched. |
| strace overhead | Warn if > 30%. No hard cap. |
| Terminal | Embedded bottom panel (xterm.js + node-pty). |
| Max session size | Warn at 100MB. Cap at 500MB (configurable). |
| Platform | Linux only. macOS/Windows deferred. |
| `perf` default | Off. Opt-in (requires `perf_event_paranoid ≤ 1`). |
| `ltrace` default | Off. Opt-in. |
| Network capture | `/proc/net/tcp` polling by default. `tcpdump` opt-in. |
| API key storage | libsecret (Secret Service API — GNOME Keyring / KWallet). |
| Session naming | `<command_basename>_<YYYYMMDD>_<HHMMSS>` |
| Sidebar position | Right by default, user-configurable. |
| Command prefix | None. User types normal commands. OpenTrace wraps transparently. |
| Virtual environments | Embedded terminal spawns `bash -l` (login shell), sources `~/.bashrc`, conda init runs normally. OpenTrace backend and traced programs are independent environments. |

---

## 12. Future Expansion

**Security Runtime Analysis Mode** — the existing data (syscall sequences, file access, network) is sufficient for lightweight sandboxing. Add a security rule profile.

**CI Regression Detection** (Phase 8) — `opentrace ci ./tests.sh --baseline <session>` fails CI if memory or runtime regressed. Baseline is a pinned saved session.

**Educational Trace Replay** — annotated playback for teaching OS concepts or onboarding.

**VS Code Extension** — gutter annotations from the last trace. Requires symbol resolution via perf + DWARF.

---

*This document is the living spec for OpenTrace. Decisions in Section 11 are locked. Everything else is open to revision as you build.*
